<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Boundary Service API provides a restful interface to a wealth of data about official geographic boundaries within Illinois.  Data is retrieved from the API as JSON (optionally JSONP) with nested GeoJSON for describing the boundary shapes.</p>

<p>There are two resources described by the API: Boundary Sets and Boundaries.</p>

<h3>Boundary Sets</h3>

<p>To see a paginated list of available Boundary Sets access the following url:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary-set/</code></p>

<p>Boundary Sets describe the extent and provenance of a group of Boundaris as well how recently they were last updated.  A complete list of properties for a Boundary Set can be introspected by accessing:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary-set/schema/</code></p>

<p>A single BoundarySet may be accessed directly by its slug:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary-set/community-areas/</code></p>

<h3>Boundaries</h3>

<p>Resources representing individual Boundaries can be accessed at:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/</code></p>

<p>As with Boundary Sets a description of all properties returned with the Boundary can be retrieved from:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/schema/</code></p>

<p>A single Boundary may be accessed directly by its slug:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/austin-community-area/</code></p>

<p>For ease of url construction a Boundary may also be referenced by appending the Boundary's <code>external_id</code> property to the BoundarySet's uri. Example:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary-set/wards/22</code></p>

<p>This returns the 22nd Chicago city ward.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The metadata fields returned with a Boundary are taken directly from the relevant data sources. In certain cases these are known to be out-dated. An effort has been made to capture such issues in the BoundarySet's notes property, but these values should generally not be taken at face value.</p>

<h3>Limiting resources returned</h3>

<p>Pagination of returned resources is handled with the <code>page</code> and <code>limit</code> parameters.</p>

<p>In addition, queries may (and should) be constrained by passing a comma-delimited list of BoundarySet slugs to the <code>sets</code> parameter:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/?sets=community-areas,neighborhoods</code></p>

<h3>Point queries</h3>

<p>The fundamental query exposed by the Boundary Service is a point-in-polygon search by latitude and longitude.  Here is an example:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/?contains=41.8903239,-87.623458&sets=community-areas</code></p>

<p>This will return the community area that Tribune Tower resides in, the Near North Side.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In addition to the <code>contains</code> parameter we also pass the <code>sets</code> parameter to constrain the query. Its important to use this parameter to limit your queries to only the data you need so your queries will be performant.</p>

<h3>Near queries</h3>

<p>The near query finds all Boundaries that intersect a circle of a specified radius using a given point as its center:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/?near=41.8903239,-87.623458,1mi&sets=wards</code></p>

<p>This returns all wards within one mile of Tribune Tower. The radius parameter may be specified in any units <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/measure/#supported-units">supported by GeoDjango</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This query will execute more slowly than the point query.</p>

<h3>Intersection queries</h3>

<p>The intersects query finds all Boundaries which intersect a specified Boundary.  For example, to find all neighborhoods which intersect the Humbolt Park Community Area, one would request:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/?intersects=humboldt-park-community-area&sets=neighborhoods</code></p>

<p>The Boundary Service does not currently support querying by arbitrary shapes.</p>

<h3>JSONP</h3>

<p>For use in client-side applications the Boundary Service API may be accessed via JSONP. Simply append the <code>format</code> and <code>callback</code> parameters to the query string:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/?format=jsonp&callback=func</code></p>

<h3>Throttling & API keys</h3>

<p>The Boundary Service API can be accessed anonymously up to <strong>100</strong> times per hour per IP address. This throttling is in place in order to ensure that it can be scaled to meet demand without extensive outages. If you intend to build an application which will query the API in bulk, please <a href="mailto:newsapps@tribune.com">e-mail us</a> your requested username and we will hook you up with an API key that allows unlimited access. This implementation will allow us to take appropriate action in the event that a single source of the traffic is causing the service to be unstable.</p>

<p>An API key is used as follows:</p>

<p><code>http://{{ settings.API_DOMAIN }}/1.0/boundary/?username=example&api_key=3b7b288ca1f9d90bef69c3eb4d880184f84ff740</code></p>
